**Description:** Teach in one of our three jungle elementary schools. No previous teaching experience is required but is highly encouraged. All subjects except Filipino are taught in English, so you must be able to speak English proficiently. You will not just be a teacher, you are also friend, counselor, health-care worker, pastor, and most importantly, an ambassador for Christ. Remember you are on location and on call 24/7. Each school has several teachers so you will not be alone.

**Requirements:** Good physical health is a must. You will be far away from any cities or towns. You will be living in a very remote jungle village with a minority tribe, so a positive flexible attitude is the only way to survive. Thankfully there is a cell phone signal available.

**Length:** School year starts at the beginning of June and ends the last week of March. Please plan on arriving two weeks early for teacher orientation. Contact us if you need a special exception.

**Description:** Teach in our new mission headquarters while the new high school is being constructed. We have about 5 students for next year. We plan on doing a remedial year to work them up to high school level. English is the major weakness, so we need someone who is a teacher and speaks English fluently. These kids come from a very communal environment. One of the major challenges we will be facing this coming year is home sickness. Your job is not only to be their teacher but also to be their mentor. Keep them motivated, encouraged, and busy learning.

**Requirements:** A flexible and willing attitude. You will be living with the directors, Jim and Moni Webb, in the new headquarters facility in Mamburao, the capital city of Occidental Mindoro. Your life will revolve around these students, they will be your focus.  Length: School year starts at the beginning of June and ends the last week of March. Please plan on arriving two weeks early for teacher orientation. Contact us if you need a special exception.
