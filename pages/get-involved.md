Teachers are needed for the elementary and secondary school. A professional teacher degree is not needed, but mostly welcomed. Important is a love for children, a willingness to serve others, an openness to learn and adapt to a simple lifestyle in remote areas and a spiritual attitude. The school years starts in August and ends in June.


### Volunteer

Volunteers are needed mainly in the high school management. This includes assisting in the kitchen, garden and housekeeping. As usual in mission projects, everyone is assisting with his abilities to serve the people.
Volunteers should plan to stay for at least 6 month. Longer terms are preferred.
