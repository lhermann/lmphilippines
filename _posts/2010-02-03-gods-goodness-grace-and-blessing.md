One day, while I sat in front of our schoolroom, I looked happily at the beautiful flowers that we had planted. I thanked God for all His goodness, grace, and blessings that I’ve received. Afterward, I recalled the time when I was troubled in my former job and also about my husband’s jobless situation. During that time, I served as one of the Barangay workers. I was required to take part in every kind of occasion. At that time, pork was the cheapest of any kind of meat in the market. So, they bought it to cook for every occasion. Being one of them, I served people pork that was not good in the sight of the Lord. I also copied the penmanship of some people to fill out papers to process additional salary for all Barangay officials, including myself, as it was approved by the council of the board during their sessions.

My conscience bothered me continually and I wanted to give up my job, but my husband had no permanent job. I had no choice but to continue in a shameful way providing for my children to live and continue their studies.<!-- more --> During my mistakes and error, I chose to follow my will and feelings and trust my own self. I was ashamed of consulting God about it. Instead, I pleaded with God to make a way for my husband to have a job. After a year, God answered my prayer for my husband. He even gave me more than I asked, for God gave me a new task. 

God sent us to be missionary teachers here. He sent our youngest son with us. Being away from my former job is a great blessing. Being here is especially a blessing to my son for he is learning how to deal with foreign people. The most wonderful thing is that he has learned how to stand in front of a congregation to lead them in singing during worship. It really gives me joy because he hadn’t done this before. God really changed him. Many times God’s goodness, grace, and blessing were showered upon me, but because of sin, I was blinded to see.

As I appreciated the flowers before me, I was reminded of God’s love. In spite of the wrong things that I’ve done, God has always been there in Heaven, watching over me, and pardoning my sin. Like flowers, I have withered away under the heat of trials, but because of God’s goodness, grace, and blessing, I have started to grow and bloom again. Amen!
