Every Friday we are so busy here in Agbalite. It is a day of preparation. Teachers are always happy if it is Friday. It means “holiday” because there is no class in the afternoon. I usually do my quizzes and chapter exams with my students on that day. In the afternoon it is our time to prepare for the Sabbath. We clean the house. We wash our dirty clothes. We cook a lot of food and invite some villagers to eat with us on the Sabbath day. We arrange the classroom to be used as our church on that special day. We also invite the villagers to attend the worship. If one of the teachers is in charge of the program, usually in the afternoon of Friday is the best time to prepare for the program. Members of our singing group are also excited to do their practice before performing. The children are also preparing. They sell vegetables, bananas, coconut, and charcoal. They earn money for their offering to the Lord on the Sabbath day.

On Friday, at sundown, teachers and children and sometimes the adults too sing praises to the Lord and offer prayers of thanks for the whole week’s guidance, protection, and blessing from the Lord. After our opening of the Sabbath, we eat together and get ready for the vesper worship. After vesper, the singing group sings their songs before they go home. It is so nice to welcome the Sabbath. This is the best and only time for me to rest well also. To rest from the day-to-day activities and to have peace of mind, is what we long for.

Thank-you, Lord, for giving us your Sabbath day! Through this holy day our strength is renewed!
