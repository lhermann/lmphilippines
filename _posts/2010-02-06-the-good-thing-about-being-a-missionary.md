There’s a woman here in our village that has been in “veggie-like” condition ever since she gave birth to her fourth child. We don’t know whether the sickness is post-partum depression or post-partum psychosis, but one thing we do know for sure, she needs our help and attention.

Até Mylene, the name of the woman, lives with her husband, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law. Kuya Jhun, her husband, is working the whole day for the baby’s milk and their food. The father-in-law is old and cannot help much, while the mother-in-law takes care of the baby and cooks food for the children who go to school. Até Mylene just lies there. She bathes very seldom. Her body is wearing away. She can’t talk, walk, or sit on her own. Will somebody care?<!-- more -->

When the missionaries learned about her situation, they started visiting her and praying for her. Then, they did small exercises on her hands and feet. I then got involved when Katie, Robert, and I visited her one day. Katie suggested that we carry her outside. We did that and we found out that she was heavy, so heavy for such a frail body. We staggered to the door of their small house. I was carrying her legs. Oh, how she stank! Once we were outside, Katie combed her hair while Robert and I sang for her. Then I told her a Bible story. 

Our next dilemma was carrying her back to her house. I prayed to God to give us strength and that we would not to drop her. We finally made our way to her bed and since I am the lightest of the three, the task of making her comfortable on the weak bamboo bed fell on me. So I pushed, pulled, and lifted her emaciated body with care. She was so heavy and dirty! At first I didn’t want to get dirty, but I could not stay clean. I had to do it! Jesus asked me to do so, like what He did on this earth – touched and healed the sick.

After this, we went home. I had a light and happy feeling. The good thing about being a missionary is to experience true happiness from making others happy. I believe the missionaries are the happiest people in the world.
