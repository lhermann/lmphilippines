Each person has their own experience and story. Sometimes the stories are simple and yet rewarding, like what I want to share.

Two weeks ago, I was assigned as spiritual leader. This job involves giving Bible studies to the villagers after class in the afternoon. I went to the house of Mr. and Mrs. Lado Parison. One of their children, Mean, was shy and afraid of me. She was around two years of age. While I was talking about the Bible, she was only peeping through the door at us. She wanted to come out, but she chose to stay inside because of me. I didn’t pay much attention to her because I wanted to share the gospel only to the adults. God reminded me though of a text in Mark 10:15. It says, “Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.” I suddenly became uncomfortable giving the Bible study while there was one member of their family afraid of me.

After the Bible study, I learned from the mother that Mean had wounds on her right foot. So, I went home and got the medicine kit and went back. I called some children that also had wounds to get her attention, but she was still hiding. Her older sister brought her to me. Even though the sister assisted me in cleaning and treating Mean’s wounds, she cried. Although she was crying, I carefully cleaned her wounds and applied medicine. Every day, before I gave the Bible study, I first cleaned and treated her wounds. Before the end of the week, Mean and I became friends. She was talking and playing with me.

It’s a wonderful blessing from God, because now most of Lado’s family is attending church services again.
