Most natives of Mindoro (called _Mangyans_) are very reserved and shy. Being one of their teachers, I have an opportunity to observe them and how they treat their parents. They don’t express their emotions like others do. They do not hug, they do not kiss, and they do not even say “I love you” to their parents. If someone comes into their house, they rather hide than accommodate them.

After seven months with them, I just noticed that they are now different. Some of them hug all their teachers. They show up when someone comes and greet them with a smile. Even if we fail to greet them, they will greet us, and I don’t know when all these changes started. All I can remember is that we never failed to include them in our prayers. We showed them that we love them in many ways, and if we didn’t hug the bigger ones, at least we touched them on their shoulders.

At this time, three-fourths of the class is responding. They hug every time they go home and some of them won’t go unless they have hugged their teachers. This is really a great change in the life of some of the native students. We continually pray for those who are not yet as bold as others, that someday, somehow, they will be able not just to hug their loved ones, but to show them that they are special to them and to God.
