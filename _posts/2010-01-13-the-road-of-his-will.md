By Annalyn Altamirano, Missionary Teacher in the remote village of Pinagbayanan
Missionary life in the field is really interesting! We touch all sorts of life. I feel that I’m standing on a pedestal. People expect that missionaries shouldn’t err. People think a missionary is like a saint.

When we came here to Pinagbayanan, I knew that I wasn’t prepared for a leadership role. I knew myself as an affable person that could easily deal with people; yet, I’m still a reserved type too. I wasn’t prepared to deal with the problems of others, hearing negative comments, and being corrected about my habitual actions which are not good for the others. In other words, I wasn’t prepared for a public life. Like Moses, as he murmured that He couldn’t lead the Israelites, God placed me here to learn the road of His will.<!-- more -->

Through encouragement to pray unceasingly, or three times a day, by Tito Joe, I am gaining wisdom to be a mature leader. I have learned that listening to negative criticism can cause a downfall in my relationship with others and my Savior. In addition to that, my husband encourages me that I have to be prepared for any comments and negative criticisms if I am grounded in Christ’s love. I also have to avoid giving any comments without talking directly to the person in charge. These things are the guiding principles that teach me that our passion is people.

I’m so thankful that I have been receiving guiding principles from the Holy Spirit. I know that through our faithful prayers I will always yield to the road of Christ’s will.
