We have a powerful God that we serve that’s the distinct difference between us, missionary teachers, and the public school teachers. It’s not good to say, but we have more integrity and love for God than they. In this experience that I’m going to tell, they, the public school teachers, saw something in us that they lack and want to have.

In just recently, we had celebrated the “Buwan nang Wika”, where KESI, Katutubo Schools Inc., and the public school merged together to make a program and to present it. They were the ones who came to us and begged to join. We’ve been praying for that true to happen, because they were our enemies. They had been robbing our students ever since and accepting our dropouts even if the students dropped in the middle of the school year. So, we were surprised and happy at the same time. We gladly welcomed them. We tried not to think that they have a hidden agenda for joining. We accepted them like our long time friends.

The time of presentation came. We hardly had time to practice, but our students did their best. Our school’s presentation was very different from theirs. Our students were lively and gay, while their students were dull and serious. I believe students reflect the teacher’s mood and spirit. Jesus brings us joy so deep that others don’t understand. Our school is really an excel school because, we have the joy of being a Christian, so much, different from the worldly joy. Our presentations were 100% better.

In basketball league, our school’s team is always winning. Our students are not that strong and big but their Master Coach is strong. They pray before the game, and they follow what the Master Coach says. Now, they are one of the teams who will compete for the championship.

The villagers are watching us. They are in awe because we have a powerful God that we serve. No matter what other teams do, our God will make us win if it is His will, and only for His glory, not ours.
