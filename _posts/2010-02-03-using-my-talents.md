One morning during our devotional, Sir Boying suggested that if you are the leader for the week, you should be the speaker during the Divine worship on the Sabbath. I didn’t agree with the suggestion of Sir Boying! I said that I couldn’t do it, but God is really wonderful. He wanted me to learn. Before my week came, I asked Sir Butch to be the speaker, but the suggestion was finalized and I needed to take my turn. When my Sabbath came I felt very nervous. I couldn’t even think to have an opening song. I sweated so much! I thought, “I am not a good speaker.” But, my team encouraged me that I could do it. Their encouragement helped to lessen my nervousness and gave me confidence. I now thank God for this wonderful experience and for the chance to use the talent He gave me; and I am looking forward to future opportunities.
