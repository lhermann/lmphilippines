I consider December 20, 2009 the day of the “Impossible Trip.” On this day the missionaries had to make a lot of tries just to get on the boat. Some of us were rolled by the big waves. We were all wet! We missionaries with children were in awe seeing how difficult it was to get our children on the boat. I had nothing to say, but just took a deep breath knowing that I would be very seasick. God protected us and we made it safely to our destination.

At headquarters we spent three days running errands. We visited our baby’s doctor and bought supplies. After doing these important things in town, we decided to go back to the village. We were fortunate to travel back to our village with a missionary couple from Binuangan. From Mamburao we had to take the jeepney to reach Paluan Bay. From Paluan Bay we travelled by boat for three hours to reach Pinagbayanan.

When we were on the sea, how blessed I was because from Paulan Bay to Binuangan it was really calm, and we enjoyed our trip. How I praised God for giving us calm seas and the thought of seasickness was forgotten. We stopped there to eat our lunch. After Binuangan the sea had a surprise for my little family, the boat captain, and others travelling on the boat. While leaving Binuangan we noticed the sea became more turbulent as we got closer to Pinagbayanan. I had been lulled into thinking that every place and direction was calm. I had totally forgotten the turbulent waves caused by the southeast monsoon. Though the sea surprised us, I loved and enjoyed the ride! Every time the boat was tossed by the waves, I went with the flow. God really answered my prayers! He is my comfort even in the midst of the rough sea. Heavenly Father, thank you that I recognize You walking with me.
