Mr. Abelardo Bacolor is a prison guard from Muntinlupa or the so called National Bilibid Prison.  He was transferred to Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm.  He was branded as the “bad boy” among the employees of the prison.  One day, he was invited by one of our inmate brethren in San Isidro sub-prison to attend the following Sabbath worship program.  When the Sabbath came, everyone was delighted to see his presence, though he was too quiet and observing.  It became a big encouragement for the inmates to have him as a regular visitor during the Sabbath service.  Sometimes he was called to participate in the program, and there was gladness as he expressed words of encouragement.

Since Brother Abel was in charge of this group on Saturdays and during weekly meetings, every time he shared something with me about Mr. Bacolor, my heart was bubbling with joy and praise to the Lord.  We put him on our prayer list, praying that some day he would accept Jesus as his personal Savior.

For about a year Mr. Bacolor attended the Sabbath worship and studied the Bible with our inmate brethren.  His heart was moved by the Holy Spirit.  Mr. Bacolor has now sealed his decision to accept Jesus Christ as his personal Savior through a “Profession of Faith” ceremony.  The district pastor officiated at the solemn program witnessed by prison personnel and inmates.  We can say that it was another milestone and remarkable moment in our prison ministry, that a prison guard be a part in the great harvest of precious souls.
