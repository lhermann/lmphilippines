God has given me some challenging and rewarding experiences this past month. One Sabbath afternoon as I was reading in Desire of Ages, I was inspired by the chapter, “Go Teach All Nations,” specifically about the author’s commentary on the verse, “They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” Mark 16:18. She wrote, “He turned away none who came to receive His healing power. He knew that those who petitioned Him for help had brought disease upon themselves; yet He did not refuse to heal them. And when virtue from Christ entered into these poor souls, they were convicted of sin, and many were healed of their spiritual disease, as well as of their physical maladies. The gospel still possesses the same power, and why should we not today witness the same results? ... And He is just as willing to heal the sick now as when He was personally on earth. Christ&#8217;s servants are His representatives, the channels for His working. He desires through them to exercise His healing power.” While laying in a hammock in our rest hut I pondered these things and prayed about them.

That night I had a wonderful time in pray with God in our garden. Not many weeks earlier we had paid villagers to cart the mulch from their rice harvest to our garden. Since then I had enjoyed many times praying on the soft layer under the stars. This evening God brought to mind the rich blessings that are ours as His children. Our eternal inheritance seemed so real and I regretted the times I had chosen the world&#8217;s pleasures over God&#8217;s eternal graces. In that time of meditation on heaven, everything the world glorifies seemed worthless. Filled with joy I praised Him and gave thanks. If only we could walk always with this heavenly view. Satan would not be able to draw us away with his cheap thrills and temporary pleasures that work ruin in our lives.

After some time I retired to my house and slept. Meanwhile, in the village Neneng and Mildred were busy tending to a lady who was having a severe asthma attack. For hours they stayed with her. First she requested that Ding and Dada come to help her and then finally at 1 am she requested that I come and pray for her.

Suddenly a light shone in my bedroom window and a man called for Benjie, one of my students. I was surprised and called out to him, but he just continued to call for Benjie who was sleeping in my classroom beside my bedroom. I joined with him in his wake-up-call until finally Benjie staggered into my bedroom. I listened carefully to their conversation trying to understand what was being said. I understood little. After their brief conversation, Benjie informed me that I needed to go with Him. This worried me a little as this kind of visit only comes when there is trouble. As I followed the man, I prayed. At the man&#8217;s house I discovered the ongoing ordeal. Remembering what I had learned just hours before, I prayed with faith that God would heal her. After the prayer her condition was unchanged. Her eyes revealed the panic within and I was compelled to continue praying beside her quietly, holding her hand. Several times we moved until finally we ended up on the rough concrete floor of her house. For hours I continued my desperate prayer while she continued to labour for breath. At about 4 am she finally fell asleep. About 20 minutes later we left wearily to find a couple of hours sleep before the dawn.

That morning Mildred visited her. The woman tearfully expressed her gratitude. After we had left she had become worried and wanted to call us back, but her husband had had pity on us. She was okay now and experiencing only a little pain. Mildred also instructed her in some lifestyle changes that she should make. They seem to have more money than most of the other villagers and frequently drink coffee. A lot of the villagers also use MSG.

When I heard the news I thanked God for healing her the way He did. Immediate healing is not always His will. In times of need like this He often allows opportunity for us to draw closer to the people through their needs. The struggles endured also test our faith in order that it might grow. It is not necessary or profitable to doubt God. He has given sufficient evidence of His love and care for us. Fretting grieves His heart and removes us from the protection faith brings. Confidence in God will not be disappointed in the end. “Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised).” Hebrews 10:23.
