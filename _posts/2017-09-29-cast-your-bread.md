Many times we read verses like "Cast your bread upon the water ..." and if you are like me, you're not giving the verse a lot of thought. Perhaps due to the fact that the verse indicates some distant event in the future, we push any focus to the nebulous "someday".

We are so caught up in the busyness of that moment that we oftentimes minimize the opportunities standing before us to be ambassadors for Jesus (2 Cor. 5:20).

In 2005 Mercy and Boni Jose came to work with Laymen Ministries as missionary teachers in remote indigenous villages of Occidental Mindoro, Philippines. With their parents came one son, Edzel and two daughters, Lilimae and Lederly.

The children joined their native friends in Laymen Ministries‘ indigenous Pinagbayanan Katutubo Excel School, where their mother was teaching. When they finished the elementary grades, Laymen Ministries did not yet have a high school, so the children attended the local public high school and then proceeded on to college. Lederly, the younger daughter, chose to attend the number one university for education in the Philippines, Philippine Normal University in Manila.

Now it is 2017 and our elementary graduate, Lederly Jose, has graduated from PNU and chose to join the LM team in the village where she grew up as a missionary’s kid. We are delighted to have Lederly join us and hear her tell how she had dreamed of being a missionary and serving our Katutubo people.

Having Lederly here with us is a joy in many ways. First, it shows how a Christian spiritual foundation matures and bears fruit. Secondly, it shows the value of a solid educational foundation. One of our students graduated from the best educational institution in the Philippines. Thirdly, Lederly is a tremendous witness to all our current native students and their parents. Education is important, and quality education pays!

Having her join us as a missionary teacher also encourages us and is evidence that our efforts on behalf of the Master are bearing fruit.

Perhaps you have been a supporter of Laymen Ministries since the work here began 19 years ago. I pray that you are also encouraged by the bread you have been casting on the water with us.

God’s word is true and I pray that you and I will be faithful to believe it and act on it till Jesus comes! Thank you for your prayers and support over the years. Truly, “the fields are white for harvest.”
