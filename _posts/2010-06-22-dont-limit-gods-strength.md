It was a wonderful Sabbath day! We rang the bell for church. I was in the Nipa (native thatch) hut while waiting for the villagers and children to come. After awhile, I saw the children coming and went inside the church. They started singing while waiting for the others to come. As they were singing some villagers arrived and joined the children’s singing. I walked down to the house and went inside my bedroom. When I was in my bedroom, I felt pain in my abdomen. Slowly, I laid down on my bed, but the pain became worse. Church would almost start in a few minutes. I really wanted to go inside the church to play the guitar, but I was very weak. I could not stand. “How can I lead the singing group?” I said to myself. The singing group would sing before the message. Shortly, I whispered a little, fervent prayer, “Lord, please give me of Your strength and use me today in the church.” After I prayed, I gained a new strength. Totally, the pain was gone. Immediately, I dressed up, got my Bible, carried the guitar, and went inside the church.

Inside the church, while I was playing the guitar, my heart was bursting with joy that God had healed me. God taught me a lesson that I should not limit His strength. I’ve also learned that God’s strength is always available to all. There is only one spring of strength that will not dry up as the time passes by. Isaiah wrote, “Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard? That the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faintest not, neither is weary? There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no night he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” Isaiah 40:28-31

God’s power and strength never diminish. His strength is our source of strength. When we feel all of life crushing us and cannot go another step, remember that we can call upon God, to renew our strength. Don’t limit God’s strength!
