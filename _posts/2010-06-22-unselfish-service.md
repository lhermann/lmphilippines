Arjay is one of Ma’am Mechel’s students in Kinder. He was diagnosed with streptococcus that caused him to be absent for almost the first week of 2010. Ma’am Mechel took pity on him because he became so thin due to lack of nutrition. He was not able to eat. Ma’am Mechel then asked help from the team and with Tito Jim’s advice we decided to treat him with Amoxicillin for five days. We could not trust him to take his medication religiously, nor could we trust his closest family to administer it, so, Ma’am Mechel and Ma’am Mhae volunteered themselves to do the job. Every morning and afternoon, Arjay went to their house to take his medicine. The two ladies prepared food for him to eat before he took his medicine.

The unselfish service came every night. Between 9 and 10 o’clock every night these two ladies would wear their jackets, take any available umbrella and flashlight, and walk into the dark stormy night just to give Arjay his medicine. The weather really tested their patience for after the medication, our nights became more fair and calm. With prayers, love, and patience, Arjay became well. He is back in school. He is very thankful to God and to his teacher, Ma’am Mechel, who loves her students. I believe it is God’s love to us that helps us love other people.
