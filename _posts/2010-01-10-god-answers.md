It is here in Pinagbayanan that I really feel closer to God. As I pray to Him more often, He is allowing me to know Him more by answering my prayers. God’s plan is sure and He is so amazing! First, He taught us about His Word, then, He taught us how to pray, and finally, He gave us the hands-on situations to really apply what we have learned.

Prayer is now a very essential part of my life. I pray for everything, anytime, anywhere. I tell Him all things that worry me as a mother, as a wife, as a teacher, and as a missionary. He answers them all. Sometimes He does not answer as I am expecting, but He does answer. He gives solutions to problems, both small and big. I pray for my daughters and I ask Him to help me to be a missionary first of all to my family and to the people around me. I prayed for relationship problems and He answered in an amazing way. There’s a lot more!

I am so very thankful to be here, serving God and learning more about Him.
