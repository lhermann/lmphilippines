In 1998, Moni and I were invited to evaluate the best way to help our indigenous brothers and sisters living around the Northern end of the Philippine island of Mindoro.

We came, we saw and we were conquered by the needs!

18 years ago we had a dream!

We were convinced that the best way to help this illiterate, minority group was education! Following the counsel of Matthew 28, GO AND TEACH was the priority!

Alan and Maritess Branson had already begun a school for those interested in the village of Hinugasan, a hour’s hike up the mountain. The coastal village of Aglimasan soon requested a school also.

Before the small school in Aglimasan was complete, the elders from Pinagbayanan begged us to build a school in their village as well.  They shared how a politician had promised to build them a school, if they would vote for him.  He even delivered some hollow block to show them his sincerity.  However, he lost the election and returned and picked up his block.

Before the Pinagbayanan school was finished, an appeal came from a sweet grandfather in Agbalite, Mr. Calve.  He shared how he wanted to go to school as a youth, but was not able.  He dreamed that his children could attend school, but that was not possible either.  Now, in his advanced years, he appealed that we build a school so that his grandchildren could attend school.  Today Calve children are attending school!

At first, the schools were non-formal, with 1 or 2 teachers in 1 room trying to introduce these “wild” children to formal education.

Within a few years, our schools were fully recognized by the Department of Education and our numbers rapidly grew to 200 students.

Within a few years, we were excited as our well prepared students were graduating grade 6 and going into Junior High School in the public schools.
**THEN A BIG SURPRISE OCCURRED!** In the public schools, there is a very deeply engrained prejudice against indigenous tribes, by both teachers and students.  This attitude was so extreme that we felt led to open our own exclusive high school specifically for indigenous students.

We opened our headquarters building in Sea Breeze to serve as our first high school.  Soon the space was cramped, but God made a way!

After searching for property to purchase, God showed us a ridgeline just 15 kilometers from the capitol of Occidental Mindoro.  Though owning property with a deed is extremely difficult here, God made it possible for us to own land with a clear title to 38 hectares.  The property fits our needs perfectly.  It is rural, isolated, very scenic, with plenty of fresh air, without air or noise pollution. Here we can grow spiritually, academically and physically.

In the Philippines, it is necessary for all schools to be registered with the Department of Education and meet their standards.  We are happy to report that we far exceed those standards.

Today we celebrate the senior high school graduation of Miss Meleth Parisan from the village of Pinagbayanan.  Meleth has persevered all the challenges to become the first indigenous graduate of any senior high school in the Philippines.

We are excited about the impact this graduation will have on other indigenous students.  They will take strength from the fact that “one of ours” has achieved this coveted level and be assured that with perseverance they can too.

Thank you supporters for helping us reach this important goal.  We solicit your continued prayers and support.  After college, our graduates will be the missionaries, teachers, nurses, etc. to their own people.

Our dream is still alive!
