The vacation was over and it was time to go back to the village where I’m working for Christ. My parents were very worried because of the strong wind. They suggested that I should hike over the mountain. They didn’t know that I was also worried. I was praying that the ocean would be calm. I returned to the mission headquarters with fear in my heart. The day came that we needed to go to the village. I was expecting big waves and strong winds. But, God is really good; the sea was very calm and peaceful. I appreciated the beauty of God’s creation.

We traveled calmly until we reached Binuangan. Then I saw the big waves and I felt the strong winds. “Wow! This is what I feared,” I said. My heart pumped very fast. Ironically I enjoyed the waves. I screamed every time the waves splashed over the boat and got me wet. It was like riding on a roller coaster. Actually we were having a lot of fun inside the boat. We were all getting wet except Ma’am Mhae and Sir Joe. They were sitting on the front of the boat and not getting wet. To make it fair, Kuya Mario gave us a bowl to get water to splash water on them. Ma’am Celestre tried to get water, but the strong waters got the bowl she was holding. We laughed and laughed even though we were wet and felt cold. I really enjoyed that trip. I didn’t even notice that we were near our destination. I thank God that we arrived safely and most of all that He helped me overcome my fear of the big waves.

God is really good! Now I can enjoy traveling by sea without fear because I know that He will always help me.
