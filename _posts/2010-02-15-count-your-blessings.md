I can still remember the time when God called me to work here in Pinagbayanan. It wasn’t my plan, but His. It could never be part of my plan. He is so good because He has chosen me to be part of His mission field, His worker; though I am not fit to be.

Tears almost fell from my eyes when we had our last Sabbath of the year 2009. I was asked to share and reminisce about the blessings I am thankful for. I told them I couldn’t say everything because there’re too many blessings to mention. I simply told how much happiness I have and hope I’ve gained because I have learned here that it isn’t difficult to follow God. All I have to do is turn my eyes to Jesus just like when the Israelites were bitten by the snakes. God told Moses to make a snake for the Israelites to look to. The snake symbolized that God had been once a man and He overcame the trials. We too are capable of overcoming if we believe in Him and let Him take control just like the Father guided Jesus Christ, His son, when He was here on this earth.

In Ezekiel 34 it says, “I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.”

In my 21 years here on earth, I can say that these days as a missionary teacher have been the most unforgettable experience. I will never forget because here I have learned and experienced walking with God.
