Last School year, Neng was always the translator of Joel’s message during Sabbath services. No one would substitute her in translating. I didn’t translate because Tagalog is not the dialog I was raised with, although I can speak Tagalog, but not as well as Neng. Even still, Neng would ask me to be Joel’s translator, and I would refuse and tell her that I didn’t know how to translate, and you are much better than I would be, plus you speak louder than me, and that is your gift from God. Each of us is given different gifts by the Holy Spirit. I made a lot of excuses so that she could't get me to do it. Neng has never stopped asking me to be a translator. Then one Friday afternoon, she told me “You will be the translator for Joel’s message tomorrow.“<!--more--> I could hear in her voice that she really wanted me to do it without any excuses. I still refused, but them my mind was drawn to Moses when God talked to him through the burning bush. He wanted Moses to go to Pharaoh to bring His people out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the people out of Egypt?” Moses made excuses because he felt inadequate for the job God was asking him to do. It was natural for him to feel that way. He was inadequate all by himself, but God said to him, ”I will be with you.” This is the comforting statement from God. He wasn’t asking Moses to work alone. He offered other resources to help (God Himself, Aaron, and the ability to do miracles). Sometimes, I also feel the same as Moses felt. God often calls us to tasks that seem difficult, but He doesn’t ask us to do them alone. God offers us His resources, just as He did to Moses. We should not hide behind our inadequacies, as Moses did, but look beyond ourselves to the great resources available.

This school year, God has been teaching me that He does not ask me to go where He has not provided the means to help me. I thanked Him that He’s been using me now this year in translation. Every time Joel asks me to be his translator in giving messages in church and in the village, I don’t refuse anymore. I really praise God for this wonderful opportunity where He can use me in a unique way. He supplies courage, confidence, and wisdom. There were times I didn’t know the English words in Tagalog during my translation, but God surprised me; it would just come out of my mouth. It is a joy to do God’s work when we totally depend on His divine wisdom and power through prayer.

As I’ve been using my unique gift to be a translator, God has been helping me. What are the ordinary things or unique gifts in your life – your voice, a pen, a musical instrument? God takes joy in using ordinary things for extraordinary purposes. Be open to God’s surprises!
