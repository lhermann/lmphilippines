There are many wonderful things God has done for me and through me and many times by surprise. One thing I want to share is how God used my hand to heal a mild sprain of one of the children here. His name is Ranjay Parison, a two-and-a-half year old boy. His mother loves to bring him to my house when he gets sick.

One day, when they arrived at my house, I noticed that Ranjay was thin and cheerless and he had a fever. My co-teacher had given him medicine for the fever, but he still had the fever. I was in charge as doctor that week. First, I bathed him before giving him medicine. Every time I touched his shoulder to scrub with a towel, he groaned. I asked him why? He replied that it is painful.<!-- more -->

I carried him and sat him down on a long bench. I put on his clothes and tried to massage him, but he refused. His mother told me that he had fallen from one of the small trees in their front yard. I didn’t want him to return home with a painful shoulder. So, I prayed to God for him immediately. Then an idea flashed into my mind. I taught him the song, “Jesus Cares for the Puppy Dog.” Then, he smiled at me. I applied the things I’ve learned from my grandmother about how to massage a mild sprain. I began to massage his shoulder while I was singing, and he let me massage him. I saw in his face that my touch was painful, but because of the beautiful song, he bore the pain.

Before they left, I asked him to kneel down with me, for we need to pray for healing. He smiled at me and followed my instruction, but not his mother. After our prayer, I asked them to come back, because I needed to massage his sprain again. One meeting would not be enough to cure the sprain.

It was Friday night when they came back. I massaged him again and successfully finished the treatment. Before they left we prayed again, but again his mother didn’t join us. Suddenly, before I finished my prayer, we heard a song from the church. When I opened my eyes, I saw Ranjay smiling and humming to the music of the song. I asked him if he wanted to attend the church service with me. His mother wanted to go home, but Ranjay asked me to carry him to the church, so, his mother joined us too.

During their visits when Ranjay was sick, I talked with his mother about God. I shared about how God healed sick people in the Bible. I explained to her that people need to have faith and trust in God. The power of healing is in God’s hand and not from us. God would be happy if she learned how to call on His name through prayer. At the end of their visits to my house, for the first time, she joined us in prayer. “For with God nothing is impossible.” Luke 1:37
