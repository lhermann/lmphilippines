Adjustment! Changes! Who said it would be easy? A new husband and wife with their many differences learning to agree and work together. A new school year starting with new students, schedules, and guidelines to follow. Transferred to a different village where the villagers are still in the early years of learning new ways of life. Forming a working unit from a brand new team of workers. Assumption would tell us it is easy but if you bring in a little common sense and thought you will soon realize that, No, it is not easy.

It can be easy to become discouraged when you have “a lot on your plate.” It can be easy to become stressed and have your body become worn out. It can be easy to forget your priorities such as special time alone with God or that special someone in your life. It can be easy to become distracted.<!--more-->

Back to “who said it would be easy?” Some days the distractions my start before the sun is up. Sometimes villagers are at the bedroom window asking for something as early as 5 a.m. Your personal conversations between husband and wife are constantly abruptly interrupted. Classes may be interrupted by weather especially now that we are in the middle of the rainy season. They are also sometimes interrupted by one of our student’s mother who has mental troubles. On one of her bad days she may come into the classroom carrying a machete while threatening to kill someone. Mostly she does no harm but it can be very disturbing to the classroom. The one thing that always throws the schedule is the constant flow of patients. Malaria treatment is high at this time of year because of all the mosquitoes that come with the rain. So, yes you may be surprised that even life here in the heart of the jungle is hectic. Who said it would be easy? Well if you have learned anything about life you know for yourself it’s just NOT easy!

“How am I to manage?” I ask myself. Then I am reminded of the verse in Zechariah 4:6. “…Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord.” Now that is not easy either, “not by might, nor by power?” Daily you have to remind yourself that you cannot do it or make it easy by your own strength. This can be a very hard for someone, like myself, who is headstrong and independent, not by might nor by power, but by His Spirit.

Daily and constantly I need to ask for His Spirit, At times it can feel like He is neglecting me but other times He shows Himself in the simplest ways. One example is through one of our first grade boys. He will always come and stand next to me at any opportunity. Sometimes when I am doing my paperwork I feel a presence behind me and then a small hand on my arm or shoulder. When I turn and see the smile on that little boy’s face my heart warms and I do feel His Spirit.

Who said it would be easy? No one, but God tells us that we can do all things by His Spirit. That is what really matters. After all, we are here to serve God and not men, right?
