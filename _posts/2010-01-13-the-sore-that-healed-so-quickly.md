It was Friday when my wife, Venus, asked me to make a shelf for our books. We have plenty of books. I made it so quickly that I still had the time to make a spear gun out of wood. I love spear fishing! The male teachers had an agreement to spear fish that weekend. It took me quite a bit of time to finish my gun. I was proud of my work. I went inside the house and played with my baby girl. “Bang, bang, bang!” I exclaimed with a resounding motion. My wife told me not to do that and not to teach our daughter the use of a gun even if it was just made of wood.

I was not really contented with the spear gun that I made because I wanted it to be smoother. I knew I needed to help my wife take care of the baby because she needed to cook our food, but I wanted to make a masterpiece of my spear gun. So, I chose the latter part. God rebuked me for not helping my wife as I accidentally cut myself. It was a deep cut on the knuckles of my hand. I couldn’t spear fish now. I couldn’t play basketball either.<!-- more -->

It happened that our baby ran out of formula. I needed to hike for ten hours out and back from our village to Paluan, the next town. Maybe it was my punishment for not helping my wife! God is so good. My wound healed after I hiked to Paluan. It was amazing because Robert had a wound and it was also deep. My wound healed faster than his. 

God taught me a lesson that day. It is His will for us to labor while it is day, for the night is coming when no man can work. I learned the value of having priorities. Recreation is good, but it should be done after all the necessary work is finished. Jesus is soon coming. He told us to share the good news to others. Are we working for Him or are we procrastinating? Let us not wait for the wound (tribulation) to come because I’m sure it will not heal quickly like the wound on my hand.
