Moment by moment God invites us to be on His side, always contemplating His words and imagining His goodness. The way we act, move, speak, and work with God reflects His character and plants the precious seeds everyday in our fellow men.

Every day in our Bible/Values class, I am teaching my students about the life of a true Christian, the Sabbath, a healthful diet, and some instructions about how to love God. Some students ask questions. Even when we discussed specifically unclean meat, I told my students that I am not who will answer your questions, but the Bible. I gave them the verses and the students read. After reading they found out that itâ€™s not me telling the answer, but the Bible.<!--more-->

There was a wedding ceremony in our neighboring village. One of my students went there. This student knew that the only food was rice and pork. He helped fetching water and doing other chores until the time to eat. He was thinking of the pork and tried to convince his taste buds not to eat the pork. He only ate rice. He really stood firm with his decision not to eat pork. Monday morning came. This student joyfully shared his experience. While listening to his experience, I thanked God for leading this student.

I am fully convinced that God is working with my students. I pray that not only this student with listen to the seeds, but the others too. Therefore, I can say that when you plant good seeds, God will take care. So, plant now!
