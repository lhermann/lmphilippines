There was an old man around 70 years old. He loves his family and has five children. Last year, this old man and his family lived in a very small house. I gave him some ideas on how to improve his living conditions. Days and months passed and he came to me and said, “Sir, would you please tell me if my idea is good or not?” I told him to tell me his idea. “I want to sell my male carabao, because it’s in danger. Some other male carabao’s want to kill mine. I will sell him and I will give you the money. It’s up to you what to do with my money for me.” I suggested to him, “What if we used your money as capital for a co-op?” He agreed.

We soon encouraged 8 other people to join our co-op. Every month, they received their shares and this old man received a larger thare than the others, because he had invested a larger capital. For the first share, he purchased logs to build his house. On the second share, he purchased gasoline, nails, and cement. Then on the third share, he was able to purchase several steel roofing sheets. Suddenly, he had all of the material necessary for making a nice house. Today, he finally has a comfortable house.

Thank God for giving me an idea to help this family live in a more comfortable environment.
