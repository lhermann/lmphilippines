My missionary life is a gift from God; I realize how God blesses us here in spite of many challenges.  We started the school year with 71 students and as of this month we have only 49 students.  They dropped for different reasons.  Some of them dropped because they have to work with their parents.  Some students were dropped because they didn’t obey some of the rules and regulations of our school.

One of the rules we implemented is that students are not allowed to watch television.  It created one of the major challenges that caused them to drop.  The students were thinking that we are too strict and not giving them the right of doing this recreational activity.  Some of the parents, instead of helping us to discipline, were criticizing us that we were not giving their children whatever they wanted.  We tried to give them some punishments to persuade them not to watch television.  It was hard for them to understand the value of morality and the truth behind it.<!-- more -->

Pursuing the truth against immoral activities oftentimes creates conflict.  People are very emotional.  As a leader and teacher, it is hard for me to handle emotional conflicts.  Some people say that, “It is easy to do for ourselves and let others go their own way to avoid conflict.”  I know that God put me here to resolve, not to escape every problem.

In just a few months, I encountered many different problems and challenges.  Criticisms are always there.  Every time I encountered negative comments, I ignored them.  Sometimes it hurt me.  So, I just sat down and thought about it.  Then, I asked myself, “Am I able to lead effectively?  Do I serve morally effective as an example for others?  Do I lead with humility and compassion?  Am I fair to everybody for every decision that I make?”   Making the right decision is not an easy task in leading people.

I learned that living in truth is an important tool in making decisions.  It is a guiding rule that God set before us.  The Bible clearly emphasizes that, “we should know the truth and the truth shall make us free.”  We can live happily because we will experience freedom from any guilt and uncomfortable feelings.  It also leads us to experience the fullness of joy in serving the Lord and the people around us.

Lord, please help me to do your will, and give me a heart where the truth dwells as a governing power to lead your people.
