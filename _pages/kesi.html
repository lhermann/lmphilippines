            Laymen Ministries mission work in the Philippines began in 1996 and
            was later headed up by Jim and Moni Webb. Our objective is to
            educate and train the poor, underprivileged indigenous “Katatubo”
            tribes with the main objective to lead them to Jesus Christ, the
            Three Angel's Messages, and how to be missionaries. As part of this
            project, every year we send young adults (i.e. student missionaries)
            to these remote villages to teach the Katatubo children in our
            remote village schools. We have had young people come from America,
            South Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and Australia. These villages,
            which use to be ruled by animist beliefs and laden with disease and
            filth, have been completely transformed through education and
            freedom through Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our mission headquarters in the Philippines also functions as a
            temporary high-school and administrative building. We have recently
            acquired a beautiful piece of land overlooking the South China Sea
            not far from the town of Mamburao where we are currently building
            our new high school and mission headquarters.
        </p>

        <p>
            These villages, once overcome with disease, filth and despair
            through ignorance, have been completely transformed through
            education and freedom through Christ. This video demonstrates the
            contrast words cannot explain.
        </p>

        <p>
            This 75 acre property will allow for more students, an agricultural
            program, mission training, as well as a secluded and healthier
            environment for the students. Laymen Ministries has a full-time
            prison ministry working in one of the 62,000 acre prison facility
            and farm. Two full-time lay-workers train and encourage inmates to
            reach inmates for Christ. This is an extremely successful program.
